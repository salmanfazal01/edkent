Refer to this Adobe XD design: https://xd.adobe.com/view/da5cd16f-2689-4398-81a0-49261327505e-8f0f/screen/85a08faa-38e7-4575-82ea-34054065c01a/


Note: how the name dropdown in the top right as well as the tab buttons are clickable. These are functionalities that you must implement in your frontend too. You can also optionally implement a calendar dropdown for the date range above the chart. The chart itself can display dummy data, but it must be interactive (not just an image).


Please implement this page using React + Typescript (Preferred) or React + JavaScript.The goal is to match the look & feel of the XD as closely as possible, and you are free to use any libraries you need to accomplish this. You should also try to structure the code in a logical manner, separating components as necessary.
